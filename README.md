# Vanilla JavaScript Seed App for SASjs

This is the minimal seed app for [SASjs](https://github.com/macropeople/sasjs).

It contains:

1. An HTML file `index.html` that loads the `SASjs` library from `jsdelivr` via a script tag.
2. Associated styles in `style.css`.
3. JavaScript code that instantiates and invokes methods from `SASjs`.

To use this app, you will need to:

1. Provide the SASjs configuration in `scripts.js`.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser(preferably Chrome).
3. Log in with your username and password.
4. Click button to load initial data.

You can then select values from the dropdown and submit requests to your SAS server.
The results will be visualised in a table on screen.
